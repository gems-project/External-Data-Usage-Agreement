# External-Data-Usage-Agreement

This document provides clarification on how contributed data may be used, shared, and credited within this project. 
These clarifications are consistent with Section 10(g) of the Terms and Conditions in the Data Usage Agreement (DUA).

# 1. Acknowledgement (applies to all publications)

For any publication that uses the DATA (including the dataset paper and all subsequent scientific analysis papers), each contributing organization will be acknowledged as the source of the DATA, in accordance with Section 10(g) of the DUA.

# 2. Dataset publication (guaranteed authorship)

As part of this project, the consortium will publish an **overall dataset paper** describing the compiled dataset (e.g., in journals such as Nature Scientific Data https://www.nature.com/sdata/aims-and-scope or Data in Brief https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/data-in-brief).

For the dataset publication **only**, each contributing organization that selected “YES” to co-authorship in the DUA will be granted:

Co-authorship (up to two authors per organization), in recognition of data contribution.

This is explicitly stated in Section 10(g) of the DUA:

**“For the publication of the overall dataset only, Organization will be granted authorship – maximum two authors.”**

The dataset paper will serve as the primary reference and will be cited in all subsequent publications that analyze the data.

 # 3. Open source option

If a contributor selects "YES" to the open source option:

Their data will be included in the overall dataset; AND

The data will be made available through the dataset publication described above.

Choosing "NO" to the open source option does not affect eligibility for co-authorship on the dataset paper.

 # 4. Subsequent scientific analysis papers (case-by-case authorship)

In addition to the dataset paper, the consortium will publish scientific papers analyzing the data.

Authorship on these analysis papers is not automatic and will follow standard scientific practice, as stated in Section 10(g):

**“Authorship on all papers for publication shall be in accordance with customary and usual publication practice in the scientific community.”**

Accordingly, co-authorship on analysis papers will be determined by the lead/first authors based on further intellectual contribution (e.g., study design, data analysis, interpretation, and manuscript preparation), rather than data contribution alone.
