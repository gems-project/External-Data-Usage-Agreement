# Data Usage, Open Source, and Authorship (DUA-Aligned Explanation)

This section explains how contributed DATA will be used in the project, what outputs will be produced, and how open source and authorship choices apply. 

The wording below is aligned with Section 8(a) and Section 10(g) of the Data Usage Agreement (DUA).

# 1. How your DATA will be used

All contributed DATA will be used solely for the purposes of the Project, including:

> Data harmonization and quality control

> Descriptive analyses and summary statistics

> Comparative and methodological research

> Scientific analyses supporting the development of guidelines for GreenFeed users

DATA may be shared among Consortium members for research activities consistent with the DUA.

# 2. Project outputs
The project will generate multiple outputs, including:

📚 **A dataset paper** describing the compiled dataset, its structure, and data collection methods (e.g., in journals such as Nature Scientific Data https://www.nature.com/sdata/aims-and-scope or Data in Brief https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/data-in-brief). This paper serves as the primary reference for the dataset.

📖 **Scientific analysis papers** addressing specific research questions and supporting guideline development. All scientific analysis papers will cite the dataset paper where applicable.


# 3. Open source choice (Section 8(a))
Contributors indicate whether their data may be included in the open-source version of the dataset.

If you select “**YES**” to open source:
Your data will be included in the dataset and made publicly available through the dataset publication and associated repositories.

If you select “**NO**” to open source:
This allows project use of the data but excludes it from public release. 
After the allowed use period, the DATA will be destroyed, consistent with Section 8(a).

# 4. Authorship (Section 10(g))

📚 **Dataset publication:**
For the publication of the overall dataset **only**, each contributing Organization who selected “YES” to co-authorship will be granted co-authorship (**maximum two authors**).

📖 **Scientific analysis papers:**
Authorship is **not automatic**, even for contributors who selected “YES” to co-authorship or are co-authors on the dataset paper.  Authorship will be determined by the lead/first authors based on further intellectual contribution (e.g., study design, analysis, interpretation, and manuscript preparation), in accordance with standard scientific practice and Section 10(g) of the DUA, rather than data contribution alone.

# 5. Acknowledgement (Section 10(g))
All contributing organizations will be acknowledged as data sources in any publication that uses the DATA, regardless of open source or authorship selections.
